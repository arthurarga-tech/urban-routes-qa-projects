# Urban Routes - QA Projects

## üì± About Urban Routes
Urban Routes is a taxi sharing and request application that allows users to plan routes, choose travel plans, and request rides in a practical and efficient way, with features focused on user experience on web devices.

## üéØ Sprint Objectives

- **Sprint 1**: Perform manual regression testing to ensure the application functions correctly after updates.  
- **Sprint 2**: Design tests and create test cases for the car-sharing feature based on requirements and designs.  
- **Sprint 3**: Test the web interface of the car-sharing feature on different browsers.  
- **Sprints 7 and 8**: Develop automated tests with Selenium, simulating the complete taxi request flow in Urban Routes.

## ‚úÖ Activities Performed

- **Sprint 1**  
  - Manual execution of predefined test cases.  
  - Comparison of expected and actual results.  
  - Recording test status and detailed documentation of bugs.

- **Sprint 2**  
  - Definition of equivalence classes and boundary values for form fields.  
  - Creation of positive and negative test cases.  
  - Collaborative documentation using online spreadsheets.

- **Sprint 3**  
  - Creation of checklists for layout and functionality.  
  - Test execution on Chrome and Firefox browsers.  
  - Bug tracking in Jira.  
  - Final test results reporting.

- **Sprints 7 and 8**  
  - Setup of Python virtual environment (venv).  
  - Implementation of the Page Object Model (POM) to organize tests.  
  - Development and execution of automated tests using Selenium and Pytest.  
  - Simulation of real user interactions in the browser and automatic test teardown.
